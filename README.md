# ReactWeather


		
		So this is a weather app I'm building to test my knowledge out

		in React. 


		I'm expecting a couple of my friends to read this repo, so 

		it's going to be loaded with comments on my basic work/thought flow.


		12/18 - 

			Finally set up the repo.


			I added a bunch of stuff on the the main component.

			Right now, it takes the location from the browser's geolocator

			and saves it in the localStorage as a fixed(2) point number.



			Also made it that it updates itself every 10 minutes, just 

			incase people are traveling. 

			I'm mostly doing it on a time limit because the free features of

			openweathermap is very... limited. 


			The same is going for the local weather data, getting it to

			update every 10 minutes in sync with the location data.


			The request for the weather data is going through pure 

			javascript. 


			I did that instead of using a library because I've heard

			something about performance benefits if you do it manually.

			Eh... We'll see. 


			Anyways any knowledge I get here, will go to rebuilding my 

			pokeDex app.
